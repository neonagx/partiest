# Project 4 - The Partiest

By Paul Baik

###Description
Tired of organizing office party through powerpoint?  Use The Partiest.  A MEAN Stack application that let's you use google maps with video advertisement from youtube.com.  You can make your office party grow your business by adding sponsors to your invites.  The more you organize office party through The Partiest, the more reward points you earn to get more free stuff!

### Approach Taken
First comes the planning phase where I would write the overall model along with wireframes and ERDs.  Once the project has been initiated, I started setting up all of back end using MEN (Mongo, Express, Node).  I would test if back end works by using Postman and initiate Front-End using Angular.
